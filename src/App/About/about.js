          <p>
            Iâ€™m Bryan Min, a student at UC Santa Cruz studying for a B.S. in Computer Engineering.
          </p>
          <p>
            I began my creative journey with a curiosity for what aesthetics means to me. Along the way, I became inspired by the minimalist era, and I now strive to produce work that is clean yet deep in emotion.
          </p>
          <p>
            Through the discovery of my artistic identity, I also grew passionate for building tools through code that can benefit me and my peers.
