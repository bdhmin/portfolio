            <p>
              Iâ€™m a fourth-year undergraduate student at <a className="ucsd" href="https://ucsd.edu" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">UC San Diego</a> pursuing Computer Science. 
              I am doing research in the <a className="creativity" href="https://creativity.ucsd.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Creativity Lab</a> on building interfaces and systems to improve workflows for productivity.
            </p>
            <p>
              Previously, I was a part of the <a className="t4g" href="https://tech4good.soe.ucsc.edu/#/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Tech4Good Lab</a>, where I developed web applications for social computing research.
            </p>
            {/* <p>
              I discovered my interest in app development for productivity while I developed social computing web apps in professor David T. Lee's lab.
              I was introduced to many differnt uses of online platforms to support growth in communities.
            </p> */}
            {/* <p>
              I began my creative journey with a curiosity for what aesthetics means to me. Along the way, I became inspired by the minimalist era, and I now strive to produce work that is clean yet deep in emotion.
