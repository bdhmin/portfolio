            <p>
              Iâ€™m a fourth-year student at <a className="ucsd" href="https://ucsd.edu" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">UC San Diego</a> studying for a B.S. in Computer Science. 
              I'm a developer who focuses on building tools for productivity and personal growth. 
              I truly believe that everyone can become a better version of themselves with the right motivators and tools, and I home to create projects that can make a difference in people aspiring to grow.
              I also do other things for fun that are related to my hobbies such as tennis, <a class="glry" href="/gallery">photography</a>, and video games.
            </p>
            <p>
              I discovered my interest in app development for productivity while I developed social computing web apps in professor David T. Lee's lab.
              I was introduced to many differnt uses of online platforms to support communities grow, be heard, and bond.
            </p>
            <p>
              I began my creative journey with a curiosity for what aesthetics means to me. Along the way, I became inspired by the minimalist era, and I now strive to produce work that is clean yet deep in emotion. My personal website attempts to practice this philosophy as its color palette, layout, and fonts have a minimalistic taste, yet components of the app shift in depth as the user scrolls.
